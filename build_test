# build-test - A minimal file to test the COPY command.

# <<< THE FIX IS HERE: Using the full, unambiguous image name for Podman >>>
FROM docker.io/pytorch/pytorch:2.2.0-cuda11.8-cudnn8-devel

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /opt/ml/code

# --- The Critical Test ---
# Copy everything from the build context into the working directory.
COPY . /opt/ml/code/

# --- The Verification Step ---
# Immediately list the contents of the directory after the copy.
RUN ls -R /opt/ml/code
